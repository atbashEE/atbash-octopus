# atbash-octopus Examples

Since Atbash depends on MicroProfile Config, an implementation is expected to be provided by the runtime.  
In case the runtime doesn't provide one, an Atbash MicroProfile Config (based on Geronimo) can be added to the war artifact by activating the profile `mp-config`. This is a Java 7+ compatible (partial) implementation.
