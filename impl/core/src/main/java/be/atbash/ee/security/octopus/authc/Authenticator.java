 * an application.  Enabling Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) behavior
 * (Two Phase Commit, etc.) is usually achieved by the single {@code Authenticator} coordinating
 * and interacting with an application-configured set of {@link Realm Realm}s.
 * <p/>
 * Note that most Shiro users will not interact with an {@code Authenticator} instance directly.
 * Shiro's default architecture is based on an overall {@code SecurityManager} which typically
 * wraps an {@code Authenticator} instance.
